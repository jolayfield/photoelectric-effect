# Week 8 — Vibrational and Rotational Spectroscopy of Diatomic Molecules

**Reading:** Engel, Chapter 8

## Overview

This week we apply the harmonic oscillator and rigid rotor models to interpret real IR and microwave spectra. We derive selection rules (reinforced by group theory), analyze vibration-rotation band structure, and account for anharmonicity and centrifugal distortion.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this week you should be able to:
- Derive and apply selection rules for rotational (microwave) spectroscopy
- Interpret IR spectra of diatomic molecules including P and R branches
- Account for centrifugal distortion in rotational spectra
- Determine molecular parameters ($B$, $r_e$, $\tilde{\nu}$, $k$, $x_e$) from spectral data
- Use symmetry to predict IR and Raman activity
