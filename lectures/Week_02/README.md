# Week 2 — The Schrödinger Equation & First Applications

**Reading:** Engel, Chapters 2 & 4

## Overview

With the experimental motivation from Week 1, we now construct the central equation of quantum mechanics. We introduce the time-independent and time-dependent Schrödinger equations, then immediately apply them to our first quantum system — the particle in a box. This gives students a concrete, solved example before tackling the formal postulates in Week 3.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this week you should be able to:
- Write the time-dependent and time-independent Schrödinger equations
- Solve the TISE for a free particle and for a particle in a 1-D box
- Explain quantization as a consequence of boundary conditions
- Calculate energies, transition frequencies, and probability densities for confined particles
