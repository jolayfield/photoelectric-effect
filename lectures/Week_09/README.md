# Week 9 — The Hydrogen Atom

**Reading:** Engel, Chapter 9

## Overview

The hydrogen atom is the only atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved exactly. This week we separate the equation in spherical coordinates, identify the three quantum numbers ($n$, $l$, $m_l$), visualize atomic orbitals, and connect to the hydrogen emission spectrum.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this week you should be able to:
- Set up the hydrogen atom Hamiltonian with the Coulomb potential
- Identify the three quantum numbers and their allowed values
- Sketch and interpret radial distribution functions and angular probability densities
- Calculate energies and transition wavelengths for the hydrogen spectrum
- Relate orbital shapes to their symmetry labels
