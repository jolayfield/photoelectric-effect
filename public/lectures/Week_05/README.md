# Week 5 — PIB Applications; Operators & Entanglement

**Reading:** Engel, Chapters 5 and 6

## Overview

This week has two themes. First, we apply the particle-in-a-box model to real chemical systems — conjugated dyes, quantum dots, and molecular electronics. Then we explore deeper consequences of the operator formalism: commuting vs. noncommuting operators, the generalized uncertainty principle in action, and the remarkable phenomenon of quantum entanglement.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this week you should be able to:
- Use the free-electron model to predict absorption wavelengths of conjugated molecules
- Explain quantum confinement effects in nanoparticles
- Determine whether operators commute and explain the physical consequences
- Describe quantum entanglement and Bell's theorem
- Explain the EPR paradox and distinguish it from "spooky action at a distance" misconceptions
