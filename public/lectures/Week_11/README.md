# Week 11 — Quantum States for Many-Electron Atoms & Atomic Spectroscopy

**Reading:** Engel, Chapter 11

## Overview

We learn to describe the overall quantum state of a multi-electron atom using term symbols, apply Hund's rules to predict the ground state, and interpret atomic spectra including spin-orbit coupling and fine structure.
