# Week 3 — Probability, Postulates & the Quantum Framework

**Reading:** Engel, Chapters 2–3

## Overview

Now that students have solved the particle in a box (Lecture 6), this week formalizes the framework of quantum mechanics. We develop the Born interpretation, normalization, and the six postulates — using the PIB as a concrete running example throughout. The particle in a box makes every abstract concept tangible: probabilities, eigenvalues, expectation values, commutators, and time evolution all come alive with a system students already understand.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this week you should be able to:
- Apply the Born interpretation and normalize wavefunctions (using PIB examples)
- State the six postulates of quantum mechanics
- Identify Hermitian operators and explain why they are required for observables
- Expand states in eigenfunctions and calculate measurement probabilities
- Calculate expectation values, commutators, and describe time evolution
