# Week 7 — Vibration and Rotation of Molecules

**Reading:** Engel, Chapter 7

## Overview

We now solve the Schrödinger equation for two fundamental molecular motions — vibration and rotation. The quantum harmonic oscillator models molecular bond stretching, while the rigid rotor models molecular tumbling. Using the group theory tools from Week 6, we classify normal modes by symmetry and derive selection rules.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this week you should be able to:
- Solve the quantum harmonic oscillator and interpret its wavefunctions
- Apply raising/lowering (ladder) operators to the harmonic oscillator
- Solve the rigid rotor problem and identify spherical harmonics
- Classify vibrational and rotational states by symmetry
- Relate force constants, reduced masses, and vibrational frequencies
