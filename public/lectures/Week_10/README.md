# Week 10 — Many-Electron Atoms

**Reading:** Engel, Chapter 10

## Overview

Moving beyond hydrogen, we tackle atoms with two or more electrons. Electron-electron repulsion makes the Schrödinger equation unsolvable exactly, requiring approximate methods. We introduce orbital approximations, the Hartree-Fock self-consistent field method, electron spin, the Pauli exclusion principle, and the aufbau principle.
