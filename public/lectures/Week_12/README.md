# Week 12 — The Chemical Bond in Diatomic Molecules

**Reading:** Engel, Chapter 12

## Overview

We develop molecular orbital (MO) theory for diatomic molecules. Using symmetry-adapted linear combinations from group theory (Week 6), we construct MO diagrams, define bond order, and explain the electronic structure of homonuclear and heteronuclear diatomics.
