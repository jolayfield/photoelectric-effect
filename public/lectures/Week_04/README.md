# Week 4 — Uncertainty Principle & Higher-Dimensional Systems

**Reading:** Engel, Chapters 3–4

## Overview

This week we complete the postulates with the uncertainty principle — verified quantitatively through the particle in a box — then extend our treatment to higher-dimensional systems. We solve the 2-D and 3-D box (introducing degeneracy), the finite potential well, and quantum tunneling. These models appear repeatedly as approximations for real chemical systems.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this week you should be able to:
- Derive and apply the Heisenberg uncertainty principle
- Verify the uncertainty principle using PIB expectation values
- Extend the PIB to 2-D and 3-D boxes and identify degeneracy
- Compare finite and infinite potential wells qualitatively
- Explain quantum tunneling and calculate transmission coefficients
