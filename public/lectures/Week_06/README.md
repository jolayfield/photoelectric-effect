# Week 6 — Molecular Symmetry & Introduction to Group Theory

**Reading:** Engel, Chapter 16

## Overview

This week we develop the mathematical framework of symmetry and group theory *before* applying it to vibrations, spectroscopy, and bonding. Symmetry is one of the most powerful tools in chemistry — it predicts which spectroscopic transitions are allowed, how atomic orbitals combine into molecular orbitals, and how vibrational modes transform. By learning group theory now, we can use these tools throughout the rest of the course.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this week you should be able to:
- Identify and perform the five types of symmetry operations ($E$, $C_n$, $\sigma$, $i$, $S_n$)
- Assign any molecule to its point group
- Construct and use reducible and irreducible representations
- Read and apply character tables
- Use the great orthogonality theorem and reduction formula
