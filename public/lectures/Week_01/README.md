# Week 1 — From Classical to Quantum Mechanics

**Reading:** Engel, Chapter 1

## Overview

This week introduces the experimental evidence that forced physicists to abandon classical mechanics at the atomic scale. We trace the historical path from blackbody radiation through the photoelectric effect to wave-particle duality, building the motivation for a completely new mechanics.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this week you should be able to:
- Explain why classical physics fails to describe blackbody radiation and how Planck's quantization resolves the ultraviolet catastrophe
- Use Einstein's photoelectric equation to predict threshold frequencies and kinetic energies
- Apply the de Broglie relation to calculate matter wavelengths
- Describe the Davisson-Germer experiment and its significance
- Articulate the concept of wave-particle duality
